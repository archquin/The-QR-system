# The-QR-system
Creates a nested dictionary for shipyard assembly and subassemblies that links the QR keys printed on a tree diagram with a central database in which key inputs that provide value outputs are linked so that more detailed monitoring of the shipyard facility may be through this approach.

Last edit:
Assembly map& assembly_map initials, are all the files needed to run Assembly_map.py
